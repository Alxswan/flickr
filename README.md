### Coding Task

Create a web page using the Flickr public feed
(https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/) that allows users to search
Flickr and see matching results.
Results should be updated as the user types and should include the following attributes:

● A thumbnail image
● The author
● The date taken
● The tags
● A link through to the full size image
We value beautiful UI/UX as well as modular/testable code.

The source code should be available on GitHub

A web accessible demo should be available, running on a host of your choice
